# proxy
why lost some proxy? and why use available proxy but cannot connect successfully?
when I crawl ip from url('xiladaili.com'),i found that some ip lost after crawl?
then i test the crawled ip, and make a list of successfully-test,and choose one of the useful id, but it turns out a connect error?
